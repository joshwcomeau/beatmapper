subtitle: About Beatmapper

Beatmapper is a web-based editor for Beat Saber‚Ñ¢. It lets you create your own "maps"‚Äîblock choreographies‚Äîto be used in-game for your favourite songs.

It's still in early Alpha stage; most of the core functionality is in, but it's a long way from a final polished product. I believe it's ready to be used, and have used it myself to create [several maps](https://beatsaver.com/uploader/5d152d44f8aa08000618017e), but you should expect the occasional bug, and for a general lack of polish.

## Features

- üíª**Cross-platform support.** Beatmapper is the only editor that works on MacOS or Linux‚Äîeven in a Windows VM, many other editors don't work correctly.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è**Low-friction.** Beatmapper aims to let you get started in seconds. No big download, no installing anything. It even comes with a demo map to help you learn the editor.
- ‚úÖ**Focus on user experience (UX).** Beatmapper will never be as feature-rich as MediocreMapper, but my hope is that it can offer the best experience in terms of usability. The goal is to create an editor you enjoy using, one that doesn't frustrate you or get in your way. This is done through an intuitive UI, good documentation, and thoughtful quality-of-life features.

## Support

In the future, I hope to add a bug-reports form through this docs site, but for now, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/beatmapper/issues) on Github, or send me an email at [joshwcomeau@gmail.com](mailto:joshwcomeau@gmail.com)
