Beatmapper is proud to be minimally invasive from a privacy standpoint. We collect very little information, and operate in a manner similar to a desktop standalone application.

This document covers the data we collect and how we use it.

## Remotely collected data

Beatmapper does not own or operate a database; as such, the information we collect is very limited.

When your computer makes a request to our web server, some basic data is recorded to identify your machine. This information includes the time that you visited, the pages visited, and your IP address.

Beatmapper does not feature any client-side analytics; we don't use Google Analytics or any similar services.

The minimal server-side analytics data collected is used primarily to give the author (Josh Comeau) insight into how many people are using the tool, and how that number changes over time.

Unlike many websites, Beatmapper does not have a user authentication / signup system. As such, I should never handle any personally-identifiable information (PII).

## Locally saved data

Beatmapper doesn't use any cookies, but we do use another form of persistent tracking: IndexedDB.

There are two pertinent differences between these two technologies:

1. Cookies are sent to the server with every request, and so this data is typically used on the backend to track you / perform aggregate calculations. IndexedDB data never leaves your device
2. IndexedDB supports _much_ larger file-sizes, and it even supports binary file sizes. This allows us to store all the assets you provide - song files and cover art - in this persistent storage.

All of the data (including files) provided when creating songs are stored this way. I also persist local application state, so that settings can be "sticky"; if you lower the editor volume today, I remember that setting and restore that value tomorrow.

All of this is done for your convenience, and is used exclusively by you. Because this data never leaves your device, it serves no purpose for me.

In the future I may wish to collect aggregate analytics about this information, to improve the product. For example, one of the editor controls allows users to increase/decrease the spacing between notes. I have no idea how many people use this feature. If the answer is near-zero, it probably makes sense to remove it, and replace it with something more useful.

## Tracking

Beatmapper uses Google Analytics to measure website traffic. This data is used to help me gauge trends, understand usage, and ultimately develop features that make sense (for example, adding mobile support might not make sense if nobody ever tries to use Beatmapper on mobile devices).

I don't collect any of this data myself, and I don't believe I have direct access to stuff like your OS or browser, I only have the data in aggregate.
