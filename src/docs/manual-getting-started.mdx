When you first visit [Beatmapper.app](https://beatmapper.app), you'll be presented with 3 options:

- Load a demo track
- Import an existing map
- Create a new map

For the quickest start, you can load the demo track, a short 1-minute edit of a public-domain dubstep track: [Only Now - Geoxor](https://soundcloud.com/geoxor_official/only-now). Please note that this map currently only has blocks (no lighting). I plan to add lighting shortly.

You can also import a map you've downloaded from [Beat Saver](https://beatsaver.com/), or created using another mapper. Beatmapper doesn't support mapping extensions, or any other custom mods, but any map that works in vanilla Beat Saber should be loadable and editable.

While these options are great for getting a quick look at the editor and playing around, you'll likely want to create your own map. From this point on, we'll assume you're creating a new map from scratch.

## File prep

Before we can start mapping, we need to get our assets in order. Specifically, we'll need:

1. A square cover art image in `.jpg` format
2. An audio file in `.ogg` format

### Cover art

For cover art, the image you select needs to be square, with dimensions of at least 250×250 (I generally aim for at least 600×600, to ensure it looks sharp on any display).

An easy way to tackle this is to grab the song's official cover art, by searching for the song name and tabbing over to "images":

<img src={googleSearchImgSrc} alt="Google Images search" width={700} />

Depending on the cover art, this may or may not produce a desirable result. Another alternative is to search for a beautiful royalty-free image on a site like Unsplash:

<img
  src={unsplashSrc}
  alt="A search on Unsplash.com"
  caption="Unsplash has many beautiful images"
  width={700}
/>

Please note that no matter where you get your image from, you'll need to crop that photo to be a square. You won't be able to upload or share your map if your cover art is rectangular.

### Song

Beat Saber requires that all songs are in `.ogg` format, an obscure alternative to the more-common `.mp3`.

We'll also need to learn a few pieces of information about our song:

- the song's BPM (beats per minute)
- the song's offset (the number of milliseconds before the song's first beat).

Our [Song Prep](/docs/song-prep) documentation covers this process in depth. If you're new to mapping, I'd recommend reading that guide in full, and then coming back here armed with a song file and all the info we need.

## Creating our song

To create your first song, select the middle "Create from scratch" option from the Beatmapper homepage:

If you've already loaded the demo track or imported an existing map, you can use the "Create new song" button in the right side-panel:

Either way, you'll be prompted with a modal that asks you for a lot of information:

<img src={newSongModalSrc} alt="New song modal" width={450} />

You can drag-and-drop your song and cover art files onto their respective boxes to associate them. You can also click the boxes to select them through the traditional file-picker.

The first three fields—Song name, Song sub-name, and Artist name—are cosmetic. They appear in-game, but have no functional effect. You can fill them with whichever values you'd like.

It's important to get the BPM and Offset values correct. For more information on these values, please consult our [Song Prep](/docs/song-prep) guide.

Finally, a difficulty must be selected. You can create as many difficulties as you'd like, so don't worry too much about this choice! You're selecting the one you'd like to start with.

After submitting this form, you'll be taken to the **notes view**. The next section of our guide covers this view.
