import PreviousNextBar from '../components/Docs/PreviousNextBar';

The "Notes" view covers everything you physically interact with in-game: the blocks you hit, the mines you avoid hitting, and the obstacles you dodge. But there's another big component to individual maps: events!

The Events view lets you customize the lighting and ring motion. These background elements are responsible for a surprisingly big part of the map's look and feel.

To navigate to the Events view, click the sun-shaped icon in the left sidebar:

import eventsViewIconSrc from './images/events-view-icon.png';

<img src={eventsViewIconSrc} width={676 / 2} />

The Events view takes inspiration from MIDI piano rolls in audio editing software. It looks like this:

import eventsViewSrc from './images/events-view.png';

<img src={eventsViewSrc} />

> This view can look a little weird/overwhelming, especially if you're coming from another mapping editor like MediocreMapper. Once you get the hang of it, though, this interface will let you create beautiful, advanced lighting patterns really quickly and easily. Give it a chance!

## Understanding the interface

In Beat Saber, maps have control over several "events":

- There are 5 lighting elements, including the track neons.
- Two lighting elements, the side lasers, can have their speed controlled.
- There are two ring-related controls, for the two rings in the environment.

In Beatmapper's events view, every event type gets its own **track**. A track is a horizontal row that displays the events over a given period of time. For example, the "Large ring" track shows every "ring rotation" event, represented as a green vertical bar.

The events view collects the 9 tracks in a **table**. The table shows a specific **window** of time, measured in beats. In the screenshot above, we see beats 0 through 16, since we're editing the very first section of the song.

A thick vertical yellow bar represents the song's current position. When you press `Space` to play the song, the yellow bar moves through the window, and will automatically advance to the next window:

import eventsYellowBarSrc from './images/events-yellow-bar.gif';

<img src={eventsYellowBarSrc} width={706} />

Unlike the "placement grid" in the notes view, however, events are not placed based on the yellow bar's position, instead, a thin white bar shows the cursor's current position:

import cursorLineSrc from './images/cursor-line.gif';

<img src={eventsYellowBarSrc} />

To place events, click within the events view. You can also click and drag to place multiple notes, according to the snapping interval.

## Track types

There are 3 distinct track types, and they're a little distinct in how they function.

### Lighting tracks

IMAGE

5 of the 9 tracks are lighting tracks. These tracks support the full range of options, including color (red, blue) and effects (on, off, flash, fade).

When adding events to this track, the vertical boxes representing events take on characteristics to reflect their color and effect. For example, 'off' events are grey to represent the light turning off. A blue "fade" event is colored blue, and features a gradient going from light to dark, to represent the event turning off.

One last unique feature of these tracks: Background colors indicate the current track status. For example, below you can see a translucent red background between the on and off events:

The 5 lighting tracks are:

- **Left laser** - a set of lasers that oscillate on the left edge of the environment
- **Right laser** - a mirror image of the left laser, but on the right
- **Back laser** - a mostly-vertical set of centered lasers
- **Primary light** - The brightest light, a `^`-shaped light in the center of the environment
- **Track neons** - a set of strips on the larger outer rings

> Note that these descriptions cover the "default" environment. Different environments lay the lights out differently, but there is always the same number of tracks with roughly-similar roles.
