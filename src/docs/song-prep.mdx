subtitle: An in-depth guide to preparing songs for mapping
---

Before we can get started placing blocks, it's important to take the time to properly prepare our songs, and gather information we'll need. Putting in a bit of time upfront can save us _a bunch_ of time and frustration later on.

This guide walks through three main steps:

- Converting our songs to `.ogg` format
- Calculating the BPM and Offset
- Editing our songs <subtle>(optional)</subtle>

This guide _does not_ cover how to download pirated/copyrighted music. There's a lot of wonderful public-domain music you can find online, on sites like [freepd.com](https://freepd.com/).

## Converting formats

Beat Saber uses the relatively obscure `.ogg`, a free open-container format. It's likely that the song you've downloaded is in `.mp3` or `.wav` format. Our first task is to convert the song.

There are [online](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/mp3-to-ogg/) [tools](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-ogg) you can use to do this conversion (plenty more can be found by googling ["convert mp3 to ogg"](https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+mp3+to+ogg)), but I believe the best approach is to use audio-editing software like Audacity.

Audacity is a free, open-source, cross-platform audio editing tool. It does a whole bunch of stuff, and we'll use it throughout this guide. Don't worry if you're not an audio engineer; while this tool is designed for professionals, we'll only use a subset of its features, and this guide covers them in depth.

The [Audacity Downloads page](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) has all the links you need, for Windows, MacOS, and GNU/Linux.

### Loading files in Audacity

To open files in Audacity, you can use the platform-appropriate shortcut (`ctrl + O` / `⌘ + O`), or use `File -> Open…` from the top menu. After selecting your MP3 or WAV file, you should see a view like this:

import audacityIntroSrc from './images/audacity-intro.png';

<img
  src={audacityIntroSrc}
  caption="This guide was written using MacOS, but the instructions should be the same for any OS"
  width={2308 / 2}
/>

To save the file as `.ogg`, you can choose `File -> Export -> Export as OGG`:

import audacityExportSrc from './images/audacity-export.png';

<img src={audacityExportSrc} width={1290 / 2} />

You can name the file whatever you'd like.

## Understanding BPM and Offset

Before we can calculate these values, it helps to understand what they are.

**BPM** stands for "Beats Per Minute", and it's a measure of the song's tempo. The higher the number, the faster the song feels. Different genres tend to fall within different ranges. Here are some common genres and their ranges:

| Genre       | BPM     |
| ----------- | ------- |
| House       | 125-130 |
| Trance      | 130-135 |
| Dubstep     | 140-150 |
| Drum & Bass | 170-175 |

In house music and other genres, a "beat" can be marked by the kick and snare drums; if you nod your head along to a song, it's likely that you're nodding on every beat. Dubstep is a notable exception, you tend to have 2 beats for every kick/snare.

**Offset** is the delay, in milliseconds, before the song's first beat.

For example, Beatmapper comes with a demo track, a modified version of [Only Now by Geoxor](https://soundcloud.com/geoxor_official/only-now). Let's listen to how this song starts:

import AudioSample from '../components/Docs/AudioSample';
import explainOffsetSrc from './audio/explain-offset.mp3';

<AudioSample url={explainOffsetSrc} fadeOutLength={500} />

There's a brief moment of atmospheric noise, then the vocal "Only now", then 3 quick drum hits before the "drop", when the kick drum hits and the song begins in earnest.

When should the first beat occur? In my opinion, it should be right at the drop, on that first kick drum. Let's figure out how to measure that amount of time.

## Calculating the offset

In Audacity, This section of the song looks like this:

import onlyNowIntroSrc from './images/only-now-intro.png';

<img src={onlyNowIntroSrc} />

If you haven't worked with waveforms before, this might be a pretty confusing view. The shape represents the sound, and the larger the shape, the louder the sound is. Along the top, numbers represent the timestamps, so that you can identify where things happen.

In this case, the drop stands out since it gets so much louder. It happens right after the `1.5`, so we know that our song should have about 1.5 seconds of offset. But, we want to be as precise as possible, so we should get an exact number.

First, click as close to the drop as you can to set the cursor to that location. Then, you can zoom in to that point using `View -> Zoom -> Zoom In`. After zooming in a couple times, here's what it looks like:

import onlyNowZoomedSrc from './images/only-now-zoomed.png';

<img src={onlyNowZoomedSrc} />

I made sure to click the waveform so that the cursor would be right on the drop. Then, I can see at the bottom of the window, the "Audio Position" is `00h 00m 01.543s`. In other words, the drop is 1.543 seconds from the initial position.

In Beatmapper, offsets are represented in _milliseconds_, not seconds. So we need to multiply the number by 1000. Our song's offset is **1543 milliseconds**.

## Using offset strategically

When you play a song in Beat Saber, the song is already playing while the environment is fading in, while you're gathering your bearings. For this reason, it's good practice to not include any blocks in the first couple seconds of the song.

As a mapper, though, it's helpful when your first block happens on the very first beat that you're tracking. Music tends to work in terms of multiples of 16 and 32; if your first block is on Beat #4, it can be disorienting. So, purely from a mapping perspective, it would be nice to start placing blocks at the "origin" of the song, on the very first beat.

Offset offers an elegant solution to this conundrum. In the case of our demo song, we can treat that drop as the "origin" point, and use offset to ensure that the song starts playing before that time.

What if your song doesn't have an intro? What if you want the blocks to start on the very first sound in the song? A common solution is to generate silence before the track starts. In Audacity, this can be accomplished through the `Generate -> Silence...` menu. You can add 2 seconds of silence to the start of your track, and then add a `2000ms` offset. That way, the origin of the song is where you want it, but the player isn't immediately overwhelmed by blocks.

## Finding the BPM

BPM is a bit harder to calculate, since Audacity doesn't have any way of determining the song's BPM. Surprisingly, this is a really hard problem for computers to solve; our brains are much better at working out BPM than computers are.

### Letting someone else do it

In many cases, another human has done this work for you already. If your song is house, dubstep, or another EDM genre, it's likely for sale on the online music store [Beatport](http://beatport.com), and Beatport lists the BPM for every song in its inventory. If I was mapping deadmau5's iconic "Not Exactly", I would search "deadmau5 not exactly" and click the first "track" result, to wind up on this page:

import beatportBpmSrc from './images/beatport-bpm.jpg';

<img src={beatportBpmSrc} caption="'BPM' is highlighted under the waveform" />

If the song you're searching for isn't in the EDM realm, you can try googling the track name + "BPM". If I wanted to map Oasis' Wonderwall, a google search reveals that it runs at 87 BPM:

import wonderwallBpmSrc from './images/wonderwall-bpm.png';

<img src={wonderwallBpmSrc} width={830} />

> Note that the internet can be wrong! The more obscure the music, the more likely the information is to be incorrect. If you notice the notes "drifting" in your song, with the first few being relatively on-beat but progressively getting less so, your BPM is wrong.

### Calculating it ourselves

There will be times where the BPM displayed online is wrong, or where it doesn't exist at all! Happily, there are strategies we can take that make the challenge pretty straightforward most of the time.

The simplest method I've found is to tap out the BPM using an online tool like [Beats Per Minute online](http://www.beatsperminuteonline.com/). This tool gives you a big button to press. While playing the song in the background, tap once for every beat:

import bpmSrc from './images/bpm-calc.gif';

<img src={bpmSrc} width={400} />

This is very much something that gets easier with practice; at first, **don't be scared to tap out 30+ seconds, and to try multiple times**. It's easy to accidentally be off by 1 BPM, which will have a noticeable effect in the quality of your map. If you get to the same number 3 times in a row, tapping for at least 20 seconds each time, you can feel pretty confident you've nailed the BPM.

### Difficult songs

95%+ of songs run at a constant, whole-number BPM like 150 or 128. But what if you want to map a song that doesn't?

If the song changes BPM, unfortunately you're out of luck for now; Beatmapper assumes songs will run at a constant BPM. I hope to add this functionality in the future.

Annoyingly, some songs run at a fractional BPM. For example, I once mapped a song that ran at 140.03 BPM. I purchased the song legally, so it's unlikely to be corrupted; perhaps the artist just wanted to be difficult. A difference of 0.03 bpm doesn't sound like much, but in a 4-minute song, it was very noticeable towards the end.

Calculating BPM to double-digit precision is a harder task, and I solved it using a program called Ableton Live. It's a little outside the scope of this documentation, but Ableton provides [excellent documentation](https://www.ableton.com/en/pages/the_bridge/tour/lesson/the_fastest_way_to_warp_a_track/) on how to do this. Essentially, our goal is to place markers on the waveform at key points so that we can calculate the BPM between them.

> Ableton Live is an expensive piece of software, but you can use the free trial. The trial expires after 30 days, but you can continue using it indefinitely; the software blocks saving and exporting after the trial period, but happily we don't need to save and export! We're only using it to work out a song's BPM.

## Editing our songs

The original Beat Saber OST songs are typically between 1:30 and 2:00 minutes long. This follows a trend in rhythm games; Dance Dance Revolution, a popular Japanese rhythm game, features songs that are rarely longer than 2 minutes.

Personal opinions vary, but in general, folks prefer shorter experiences. If I have 15 minutes to play Beat Saber, I'd prefer to play 7 short songs over 3 long ones.

Additionally, it's _much, much easier_ to map a 2-minute song than a 5-minute song. A common beginner mistake is to over-use copy/paste, and wind up with a repetitive, unenjoyable map to play. When you have 5 minutes of music to map, it is very difficult to keep coming up with novel patterns and unique choreographies. It's much easier to create a banging 2 minute map.

But, most music tends to be pretty long. It's not uncommon for House songs to be 8-9 minutes or longer!

Rather than limit ourselves to songs that are naturally under 2 minutes, a great strategy is to trim our songs to be shorter.

This next section of the guide covers a few basic editing strategies. The exact technique will depend on the song and which parts of it you'd like to preserve.

### Ending a song prematurely

The simplest way to shorten a song is to decide to end it sooner. Many songs will follow a pattern of drop-breakdown-drop, and so if we can end our song after the first drop, we'll likely cut the song's length in half!

Our demo track, Only Now, has a few breakdowns. Let's say we want to end our song right after that first drop, around 55 seconds in:

import onlyNowZoomedOutSrc from './images/only-now-zoomed-out.png';

<img src={onlyNowZoomedOutSrc} />

The first step is to delete a big chunk of the song. I clicked on a spot a few seconds after the start of the breakdown. With the cursor at the right spot, you can choose `Select -> Region -> Cursor to Track End` to select everything after the cursor, and then `Edit -> Delete` to remove the selection.

Of course, this produces a jarring effect where the song ends abruptly. We can fix this! We can have the song fade out over a few seconds, for a natural-sounding finish.

I selected the last 3 seconds of the clip and then chose `Effect -> Fade Out`. This fades the song out over the selected range. Here's the final result:

import fadeOutSrc from './audio/fade-out.mp3';

<AudioSample url={fadeOutSrc} fadeOutLength={500} />

The effect isn't perfect, but it really helps it _sound like_ the end of a song. Most players won't be able to tell that you've done some editing, and even those that can will likely be thankful that you've created a concise map!

### Stitching sections together

In the Beatmapper's demo track, I had a 3-minute song that had a good part near the start, and a good part near the end. Rather than choose one and use fading to cut out the rest, I wanted to cut out the middle of the song and stitch the start to the end.

Without going too deep into music theory, most songs consist of sections, and most sections are either 16 or 32 bars long. In most songs, a bar is 4 beats. So, there's a good chance that if you cut out chunks of 32 bars, you'll wind up with something that flows alright, especially if the sections are similar. If a song has two drops, you can usually trim everything from the first drop to the second without it being noticeable.

This is a tricky proposition in Audacity, because timing in Audacity is based on time (seconds/milliseconds), and our song passes in bars and beats. There is no ability to view time as bars/beats in Audacity, and because of that, it's hard to make sure that the song is stitched together evenly.

The first thing we need to do is identify the range we want to cut out. In my case, maybe I want to cut everything between these two similar-sounding sections of the drop:

import selectionSrc from './images/selection.png';

<img src={selectionSrc} />

Deciding where to place these markers is more art than science; listen to the song, and see if you can imagine it jumping from one marker to the other. Are the sections similar enough for it to work?

Once you've locked down the position for the markers, we need to select and delete everything between them. Audacity makes this possible by allowing you to "store" a cursor position.

First, let's zoom wayyyy in on the start marker position. We want to be as precise as possible here, since any errors will cause all blocks after the edit to be slightly off-beat. Here's about how far I typically zoom:

import superzoomSrc from './images/superzoom.png';

<img src={superzoomSrc} />

When the marker is right at the point you want to cut, choose `Select -> Store Cursor Position`. You won't notice any change, since all we've done is stored a piece of data.

Next, zoom back out and navigate over to the end marker. Once again, zoom in and place the cursor right at the moment you want to cut.

Finally, choose `Select -> Cursor to Stored Cursor Position`. This will select everything between the last cursor position and the current one. Once the selection is made, you can delete it by choosing `Edit -> Delete`.

Zoom back out and see how it sounds. It's a common mistake to accidentally delete a little bit too much, or not quite enough, and wind up 1 or 2 beats off. You can undo this deletion and repeat the process until it's perfect.

### Thinking in chunks

Sometimes, you may find yourself in the situation where a song has 45 seconds of material, and you find it drags on a bit long; you want to include the section, you just wish it was shorter.

One of my favourite tricks is to halve the length of sections. The difficulty of this trick varies greatly depending on the song, but the basic strategy is to figure out how many beats a section is. For example, many songs will have a 32-bar (128-beat) drop, where it's comprised of 4 similar 8-bar sections.

> While the number of beats in a bar depends on the song's time signature, it's almost always "4". This guide talks in terms of bars, but you can multiply that number by 4 to get the number of beats.

Let's consider the fantastic song [4Me by Bad Computer](https://open.spotify.com/album/6D4GGf00svu54pPkpe8ma1):

import badComputerWaveformSrc from './images/bad-computer-waveform.png';

<img src={badComputerWaveformSrc} />

This song has 16 bars of intro, and then 32 bars of "drop", with 4 clear similar-sounding sections, before the song's breakdown / buildup / second drop:

import badComputerWaveformAnnotatedSrc from './images/bad-computer-waveform-annotated.png';

<img src={badComputerWaveformAnnotatedSrc} />

> It really helps to think of music in terms of "chunks" like this - it gives you a much clearer understanding of the types of edits that are possible!

While the song is great, in a Beat Saber context I wish the drop wasn't quite so long. So how do we fix this?

The simplest approach would be to snip out Drop sections A+B, or C+D. The thing is, most music has some big sound effect on the drop, at the start of section A. Also, many songs will feature some increasing tension at the end of section D. So the best-sounding edit is to snip out **B and C**, connecting A directly to D:

import badComputerWaveformTweakedSrc from './images/bad-computer-waveform-tweaked.png';

<img src={badComputerWaveformTweakedSrc} />

This edit is absolutely seamless, and it helps guarantee a fun, replayable map. We could repeat this same trick for the second drop, which also looks a bit long, or simply fade out during the buildup!

### Editing conclusion

These types of edits may seem tedious and time-consuming, but they wind up saving a lot of time in the long run. Especially for newer mappers, mapping a song can take multiple hours for every minute of audio, and so you can save many hours of work by spending a few minutes on the edit beforehand.

You can use these tricks in combination, and there are many other tricks as well. once you get comfortable editing audio, new possibilities emerge: You can stitch together multiple tracks into a unique mix, for example! It's worth experimenting with.

## Using this information in your map

Now that you've gotten an appropriate `.ogg` song track, and you know its BPM and offset, it's time to start mapping! Our [User Manual](/docs/getting-started#creating-our-song) picks up from this point.

Happy mapping!
