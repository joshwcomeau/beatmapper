As you work on your map, you'll undoubtedly want to try your map out on your headset! And, once you're ready to share it with others, you'll want to publish it.

This section of the guide covers how to export from Beatmapper.

## Editing map details

While you added some basic details during the map creation process, there are some other things we'll want to set up before finishing up. Let's head over to the next tab in our left sidebar, the "Song Details" tab:

This tab lets you tweak a few more things, including the name you'd like to be credited under for your map, the environment you'd like your map to use, and which parts of the song should constitute the preview.

If you scroll down, you can also see settings for the beatmap you've been working on:

Note Jump Speed and Start Beat Offset are outside the scope of this guide, but I hope to add information soon!

## Downloading your map

Finally, the last main tab in the left sidebar is the "Download" tab.

The large pink button will download a .zip that includes all relevant files, in a format ready to be consumed.

**Protip:** You can download your map at any time using `ctrl + S` (or `âŒ˜ + S`). **It's recommended that you save often**; while not super common, the browser may occasionally decide to empty out the locally-persisted data, which includes all your work on your maps!

> You'll also see a smaller button to download "legacy" files. These files are formatted for an older version of the game. This option remains relevant only because other editors like MediocreMapper were never updated to use the new file format. Use this only if you plan to move between editors.

## Playtesting your map

The .zip file downloaded from Beatmapper is formatted to be dragged-and-dropped for Quest users, using programs like BeatOn. It also matches the format provided by sites like Beat Saver / BeastSaber, so you can use your newly-downloaded map the same way you use any of those.

If you have never used custom songs with Beat Saber, I'm afraid you'll need to seek help elsewhere; this is beyond the scope of this documentation.

## Publishing your map

When you're fully satisfied with your map, it's time to publish!

The two main sites used for downloading maps are [BeastSaber](http://bsaber.com) and [Beat Saver](http://beatsaver.com). Both of these sites use the Beat Saver repository.

> Note: The instructions below were captured in early October 2019. It is possible that Beat Saver's UI will change by the time you read this. This is therefore meant as a rough guide, and may need a bit of interpreting.
